#
# Docker image for building Advanced Analytics modules on continuous
# integration build agents.
#
# Note: A Docker container is used for the build process as it gives
# greated control of the build environment, allowing the build itself
# to install all required packages and dependencies inside the
# container.  The continuous integration environment then only needs
# to provide Docker support.
#

# Use CentOS base image
