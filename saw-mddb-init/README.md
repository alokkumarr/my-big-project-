# Introduction

Utility to load sample semantic metadata into Metadata Service

# Notes

If loading data for the first time, change the verbs from "update" to
"create".  Save the output from the execution and update the sample
JSON files with the new IDs (both semantic nodes and the data objects,
including references to data objects from semantic nodes).
