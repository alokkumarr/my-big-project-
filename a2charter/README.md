# A2Charter

A2Charter is not being used because Synchronoss Insight Platform has visualization module. This package was developed to demonstrate what R provides out of the box. It was build on top of packages as follows:

* [a2modeler](https://stash.synchronoss.net/projects/BDA/repos/sip/browse/a2modeler)
* [a2munge](https://stash.synchronoss.net/projects/BDA/repos/sip/browse/a2munge) 

### Todos

 - Remove A2Charter package from the build
