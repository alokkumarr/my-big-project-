# scripts of the "saw-transport" service package seems to be run after
# the creation of the same link in the new "sip-transport" package
# during upgrade using the "Obsoletes" RPM header, causing the
# installation to end up without any link at all.  So as a workaround,
# explicitly remove the old "saw-transport" package.  This workaround
# can be removed once all environments have been upgraded to SIP 3.3.

# Workaround: The service restart handler will run only after all
# tasks have completed.  This causes the service to remain running
# using the old port when the new socket activation proxy starts up,
# resulting in a port already in use error.  So trigger the restart
# handler already here, to force the service to pick up the new port
# setting before starting the socket activation proxy.  Can be removed
# as no longer needed after the next SAW release.
