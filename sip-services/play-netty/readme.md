#About this module :
This Module has added as workaround for transport service with spark-2.3.2
upgrade to resolve the netty library conflict with play framework and
spark 2.3.2. This module will produce the play compatible netty library.

#Future Note :
This needs to be removed once transport service refactoring complete and 
play framework will be removed in future, SIP-1835 for more details.
