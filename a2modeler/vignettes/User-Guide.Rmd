## Workflow

A key deisgn principle of a2modeler is the set of high level functions common to multiple use cases seen in the image below. In this section each of the distinct workflow steps represented as a high level a2modeler function is reviewed and gone into detal.

![a2modeler Workflow](figures/a2modeler-workflow.jpg)

#### Setup

The first step of building an a2modeler model is to set up and define the meta data parameters. It is in this step where the use case is defined through a specific a2modeler function, the model data set is defined, target variable if applicable and various other inputs.

```{r echo=FALSE}

tibble(`Use Case` ="Regression",
       Description = "Statistical models to fit and make prediction for continuous numerical targets",
       `Back End` = "Spark-ML") %>% 
  add_row(
    `Use Case` = "Forecasting", 
    Description = "Statistical models to make forward looking predicts of sequential or time series data",
    `Back End` = "R forecast package") %>% 
  add_row(`Use Case` ="Segmentation",
          Description ="Statistical models to derive sub-groups withing a dataset based on measurable patterns",
          `Back End` = "Spark-ML") %>% 
  add_row(`Use Case` ="Classification",
          Description ="Statistical models to fit and make prediction for binary targets such as Yes/No, 0/1, Hot Dog/Not Hog Dog",
          `Back End` = "Spark-ML") %>% 
  add_row(`Use Case` = "Multi-Classification",
          Description ="Statistical models to fit and make prediction for discrete targets with more than two unique values",
          `Back End` = "Spark-ML") %>% 
  knitr::kable(.,
               caption = "a2modeler Use Cases")

```


##### Regressor

The a2modeler regressor is used to create a regression object. Regression is a supervised learning approach where the target variable is numeric and typically continuous. 

The key inputs are the dataframe to be used to develop the model and the target variable. Note: all other non-target variables in the dataframe are available for feature engineering. The latter is true for all a2modeler objects. 

Currently only the spark-ml backend via sparklyr^[sparklyr R package [via](https://spark.rstudio.com/mlib/)] is supported for the regressor. That means the dataframe provided should be a spark object. a2modeler requires spark 2.3.0 version or higher. 

```{r regressor, eval=FALSE}

### Regressor Example:

# Create Spark Connection
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3.0")

# Copy data to spark
df <- copy_to(sc, mtcars, name = "df", overwrite = TRUE)

# Regressor
r1 <- regressor(df     = df,
                target = "mpg",
                name   = "example")

```


##### Forecaster

The forecaster function is used to create a forecasting object. Forecasting is a form or regression applied on sequential, or time indexed datasets. Typically lagged or historical values of a target variable are used as predictors. The predictions from forecaster are strictly forward looking. As such, features used in forecaster need special care so that predictions are made ex ante requiring all features are known at time of prediction. 

Currently forecaster only supports the great forecast^[forecast R package [via](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/)] R package. Forecaster does support auto-forecasting R and spark based approaches. More on this in later section.

An additional input for the index variable is required. The index variable is used internally to arrange the datasets and indexed predictions. The index variable (along with the target) is removed from the potential predictor variables. 

```{r forecaster, eval=FALSE}

### Forecaster Example

# Simulated Time Series Data
select(sim_df_ts, index, y)

f1 <- forecaster(df        = select(sim_df_ts, index, y),
                 target    = "y",
                 index_var = "index",
                 name      = "example")

```


##### Segmenter

Segmenter is an a2modeler function to create a segmentation or clustering model. Cluster modeling is a form of unsupervised learning that looks for patterns to define sub-groups of records in a dataset. The segmenter does not take a target or index variable input. 

The segmenter is supported with the Spark-ML backend.


```{r segmenter, eval=FALSE}

### Segmenter Example:

# Copy data to spark
df <- copy_to(sc, mtcars, name = "df", overwrite = TRUE)

# Segmenter
s1 <- segmenter(df     = df,
                name   = "example")

```



##### Classifier

Classifier is an a2modeler function to create a classification model. Classification is a special case of supervised learning where the target variable is binary. Classification models are often used to create both binary predictions and class probabilities predictions. The latter is sometimes refered to as propensity modeling. 

The classifier is supported with the Spark-ML backend.


```{r classifier, eval=FALSE}

### Classifier Example:

# Copy data to spark
df <- copy_to(sc, mtcars, name = "df", overwrite = TRUE)

# Classifier
c1 <- classifier(df    = df,
                 target = "am",
                 name   = "example")

```



##### Multi-Classifier

Multiclassifier is a similiar function to the classifier. The multiclassifier is appropriate for target variables with more than 2 discrete values. 

The multiclassifier is supported with the Spark-ML backend.


```{r multi-classifier, eval=FALSE}

### Multi- Classifier Example:

# Copy data to spark
df <- copy_to(sc, iris, name = "iris", overwrite = TRUE)

# Classifier
c1 <- multiclassifier(df     = df,
                      target = "Species",
                      name   = "example")

```


##### Common Inputs

In addition to the required inputs of the dataframe, target and index variables if required, the following inputs can be provided for meta-data purposes:

* __name__: optional name for use case. Used in reporting and deployment pathing 
* __uid__: optional input for unique identifier
* __version__: optional input for use case version. Used in report and pathing
* __desc__: optional input for use case description
* __scientist__: optional input for data science developer
* __execution_strategy__: input for parallel backend execution. Default is sequential. Leverages the future^[future R package [via](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/vignettes/future-1-overview.html)] for parallel execution. 
* __refit__: Logical option to refit model to entire training dataset sample and validation fitting. If grid parameters supplied, the best param set determined by validation sample performance will be used. Default is TRUE.
* __save_submodels__: logical flag to save sub model fits. Default is TRUE. 
* __dir__: optional directory path for saving reports, data, and models
* __seed__: seed number for random computations. Seed should be set to ensure repeatability of results.


#### Sampling

Now that the use case is defined and data inputs provided, the sampling criteria used in the model training/validation/testing should be defined. In a typical modeling workflow, the initial data provided is split into multiple chunks where one data sample is used to fit the model (training dataset) and a different sample is used to evaluate the model (validation dataset). The key concept is that the model predictions are evaluated on a dataset not used to fit the model. Some algorithms have the power to fit a provided dataset quite precisely, too precisely in fact, if the predictions results are not generalizable to new data samples. This is known as overfitting. A third sample is often used as a test sample once the final model is selected amoung many based on validation sample results as a final measure of predictive performance. 

The a2modeler package currently supports the following sampling techinques:

* __default__: single training sample only. Not recommend for more than simple exploratory examples
* __holdout__: creates two or three data samples. Controled by split parameter. Sum of split parameter should equal 1. Each value represents the amount of data partitioned to each split. The order of the values matters - the splits correspond to train/validation/test samples. Test value optional. 
    + ex - splits = c(.60, .20, .20): creates three samples. The training sample is 60 percent of the data, the validation sample is 20 percent and the test sample is the last 20 percent.
* __random__: creates one or more random samples. The sample percentage of the total data is controlled through the amount parameter. There is an additional option for adding a test holdout sample.
* __time slices__: creates one or more time slice samples which align the training sample with the validation sample by the index variable. Time slices are appropriate for forecasting use cases where the order of the data matters. The samples can be modified by width, horizon of predictions, and by sequence. There is an additional option for adding a test holdout sample.
* __cross validation__: cross validation samples^[cross validation [via](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics))] are widely used in machine learning model building workflows. Cross validation samples splits the data into multiple samples but ensures that each sample is used in one validation sample. The number of folds controls how many sampling pairs there are along with the amount of data in each. There is an additional option for adding a test holdout sample.


Sampling is typically the second step in the workflow. Each of the sampling methods above can be "added" to the modeler object with the function convention of `add_*_samples()` where the sampling method is substitued for *. Examples below.

```{r sampling, eval=FALSE}

# Regressor with Training/Validation/Test Holdout Samples:
r1 <- regressor(df     = df,
                target = "mpg",
                name   = "example") %>% 
  add_holdout_samples(splits = c(.6, .2, .2))


# Regressor with 5-fold Cross-Validation and Test Holdout Samples
r2 <- regressor(df     = df,
                target = "mpg",
                name   = "example") %>% 
  add_cross_validation_samples(folds = 5, test_holdout_prct = 0.2, seed = 319)
```


```{r sampling2, eval=TRUE}


# Forecaster with holdout samples
f1 <- forecaster(df        = select(sim_df_ts, index, y),
                 target    = "y",
                 index_var = "index",
                 name      = "example") %>% 
  add_holdout_samples(splits = c(.6, .2, .2))

# Forecaster with time-slices
f2 <- forecaster(df        = select(sim_df_ts, index, y),
                 target    = "y",
                 index_var = "index",
                 name      = "example") %>% 
  add_time_slice_samples(width = 50, horizon = 5, skip = 0)
```

The sample step creates a samples object and saves to the modeler object.  The samples object containts row indicies for each sample. The indicies are used internally by the a2modeler functionality to partition the data into the correct samples.

```{r}

# Stored samples object
f1$samples
```


#### Measurement

The next step is to define the criteria and metric for model measurement. The a2modeler package comes with several measures, however, measures are generally appropriate only for a specific use case. In the measure print outs below, the measure properties lists which use cases are appropriate. 

```{r measures}

# RMSE
RMSE

# MAPE
MAPE

# AUC
AUC

# F1
F1

# Silhouette
Silhouette
```


Each use case has a default measure, however, the measure can be explicitly added to a modeler object with the `set_meaure` function. The measure is stored in the modeler object and is used when model performance is measured.

```{r}

# Forecaster with RMSE Measure
f1 <- forecaster(df        = select(sim_df_ts, index, y),
                 target    = "y",
                 index_var = "index",
                 name      = "example") %>% 
  add_holdout_samples(splits = c(.6, .2, .2)) %>% 
  set_measure(RMSE)

# Forecaster measure
f1$measure

```


#### Models

One or more models can be added to a modeler object. Each model added will be trained, validated and given opportunity for final selection on the same set of samples. In the a2modeler package a model is uniquly defined by three components:

* __Method__: the model algorithm to use. See following section for available methods
* __Features__: the feature engineering pipeline used to capture any transformations made on the input dataset
* __Parameters__: the configuration of any model algorithm meta-parameters


Adding a new model to a model is done by calling the `add_model` function shown below. Note the named method is the only required input. The default pipeline is NULL which produces the identity transformation. The default param_map (input for the parameters) is an empty list. 

```{r}

# Forecaster with auto.arima function
f1 <- forecaster(df        = select(sim_df_ts, index, y),
                 target    = "y",
                 index_var = "index",
                 name      = "example") %>% 
  add_holdout_samples(splits = c(.6, .2, .2)) %>% 
  set_measure(RMSE) %>% 
  add_model(pipe = NULL, 
            method = "auto.armia",
            param_map = list())
```


##### Method

The following model methods by use case type are supported

```{r}

# Model Methods
model_methods %>% 
  select( -class) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.,
               caption = "Model Methods")
```


Methods are specified with a string input within the `add_model` function.  

##### Features

Feature generation is included in the model definition. This design allows for feature generation changes to be tested in the same manner as model method or parameter changes. Features are encapsulated within a pipeline object. The pipeline object (shown below) stores the transformation logic, some meta-data, and potentially pipeline output. Appending transformation output to the pipeline is useful for cases when that output is used more than once

```{r}

# Basic Indentity pipeline
pipe <- pipeline(expr = identity,
                 desc = "example")
pipe
```

There are a few basic pipeline methods shown below

* __flow__: apply pipeline expression on dataset. output not saved to pipeline
* __execute__: apply pipeline expresssion on dataset. output saved to pipeline
* __test__: apply pipeline expression on subset of data records
* __clean__: removes stored output from pipeline

```{r}

# Pipeline example
new_pipe <- pipeline(
  expr = function(df) {
    df %>% 
      select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
      mutate_all( funs((. - min(.)) / max(.)))
  },
  desc = "normalize numeric variables",
  uid = "get-normal-pipe"
)
new_pipe


# Flow example
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, wt, hp) %>% 
  flow(pipe = new_pipe)

# Execute example
updated_pipe <- mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, wt, hp) %>% 
  execute(pipe = new_pipe)

# Pipe output
updated_pipe

```

Pipelines can be created externally to a modeler object and passed in as an argument to one or more models



##### Parameters

Many model methods have configurable parameters that should be specified. Parameter settings can impact a models performance greatly and it is good practice to test several values for important parameters. Testing of parameter values is sometimes referred to as model tuning. 

Parameters values are configured for a2model with the param_map argument. The param_map takes a named list with parameter names and unique values to test. Under the hood, the a2modeler object will create a grid of possible parameter value combinations based on the param_map input and create a unique model for each. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Regression example with paramater grid
r1 <- regressor(df     = df,
                target = "mpg",
                name   = "example") %>% 
  add_holdout_samples(splits = c(.6, .2, .2)) %>% 
  set_measure(RMSE) %>% 
  add_model(pipe = NULL,
            method = "ml_linear_regression",
            param_map = list(reg_param = c(0, 0.01),
                             elastic_net_param = c(0, 0.01)),
            desc = "linear example with param grid"
            uid = "linear") 

```


```{r echo=FALSE}

expand.grid(reg_param = c(0, 0.01),
            elastic_net_param = c(0, 0.01)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(.,
               caption = "linear model parameter grid")

```

Note, valid named arguments need to be provided. Method arguments can be found by looking at the native R help documentation

```{r}
# Method help
?ml_linear_regression
```



Putting it all together, in the following chunk a foreacaster is created with multiple models. Individual models are stored as list in the modeler object

```{r}

# Lagged Pipe
lag_pipe <- pipeline(
  expr = function(df) {
    df %>% 
      lagger(order_vars = "index",
             measure_vars = "y",
             lags = 1:7)
  },
  desc = "Create lagged values of y variable",
  uid = "lag-pipe"
)

# Forecaster with multiple models
f1 <- forecaster(df        = select(sim_df_ts, index, y),
                 target    = "y",
                 index_var = "index",
                 name      = "example") %>% 
  add_holdout_samples(splits = c(.6, .2, .2)) %>% 
  set_measure(RMSE) %>% 
   add_model(pipe = NULL, 
            method = "auto.arima",
            param_map = list(),
            uid = "auto-arima") %>% 
  add_model(pipe = lag_pipe, 
            method = "auto.arima",
            param_map = list(),
            uid = "auto-arima-lag-pipe") %>% 
  add_model(pipe = lag_pipe, 
            method = "ets",
            param_map = list(model = c("AAA", "ANN", "ZZZ")),
            uid = "ets-lag")

# Models by Status
purrr::map_df(f1$models, "status")

```
