# Workaround: The service restart handler will run only after all
# tasks have completed.  This causes the service to remain running
# using the old port when the new socket activation proxy starts up,
# resulting in a port already in use error.  So trigger the restart
# handler already here, to force the service to pick up the new port
# setting before starting the socket activation proxy.  Can be removed
# as no longer needed after the next SAW release.
