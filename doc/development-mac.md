# Setup instructions for Mac

If you are on a Mac the required tools can be installed using
[Homebrew] as follows:

        $ brew cask install java
        $ brew install maven
        $ brew cask install docker

After installing the above on a Mac, open the Docker application to
install the command line tools and launch the Docker daemon:
