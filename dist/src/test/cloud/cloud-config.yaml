  # To limit costs, by default shut down after a couple of hours
  # (typical working session).  Only stop the instance, but do not
  # terminate it.  This preserves the instance storage which has a
  # certain cost, but on the other hand saves the container image
  # cache which makes subsequent deployment cycles faster.  Note:
  # Schedule the shutdown in "bootcmd", instead of "runcmd", to ensure
  # it is run on every instance start and not just after initial
  # provisioning.
