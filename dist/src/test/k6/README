K6 for SIP PAC testing.

Pre-requisite : To run the load test successfully from local machine, following are the list of tools/softwares that needs to be installed. 
i.)	K-6 : K-6 provides support for different machine/OS. K-6 can be downloaded from here. Once K-6 is installed you can check whether installation is done correctly by typing ‘k6’ in your command/terminal window. 

ii.)	InfluxDB : K-6 provides the ability to store the result in a database. It the compatibility with InfluxDB to store the result. One can download InfluxDB from here and follow the instructions.

iii.)	Grafana : K-6 provides the functionality to visualize the output for better analysis so that performance of the app can be improved. K-6 uses Grafana to present the output in form of chart. One can download Grafana from here and follow the instructions.

Steps to run the load test : 
i.)	Open the command prompt/terminal window and navigate to the directory which has contains ‘index.js’ file. Let say it root directory. 


ii.)	Type the following command  k6 run index.js. This will initiate the process of running the load tests and result can be seen in command prompt/terminal window once execution is finished.


Storing the result to InfluxDB :  To Store the result to InfluxDB, below steps needs to be followed.
i.)	Open another command prompt/terminal window .Navigate to directory which has influxd file present in downloaded InfluxDB directory.


ii.)	Run influxd command to run InfluxDB. You should see InfluxDB is up and running. Default port for InfluxDB is 8086. 


Displaying the result using Grafana : Once the InfluxDB is up and running, we need to run Grafana-server to visualize the output. To run Grafana below steps needs to be taken care of.

i.)	Open another command prompt/terminal window .Navigate to directory which has Grafana-server file present in downloaded Grafana directory.


ii.)	Run grafana-server command to run Grafana. You should see Grafana is up and running. Default port for Grafana is 8080. 

  Creating first Data Source : Next step is to create the Data Source to store the output of load tests. Steps are as follows.
i.)	Open web browser. Type ‘localhost:8080’ (8080 is port number on which Grafana is running. It may vary in your case.)


ii.)	Login with credentials (If any). The default username is ‘admin’ and password is ‘admin’.


iii.)	Navigate to Configuration -> DataSource. Click on ‘+ Add data source’ button


iv.)	Give the database name. Select type to InfluxDB. Select the options (If any) and click ‘Save & Test’ button. Now you have active database to store the output od load tests.

Run the command to store the result : Run the following command to store the result to influxDB. 

k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:[InfluxDb_port_goes_here]/[database_name_goes_here] index.js
Change the content between [] with respective values. The above command will store the result to database.

Visualize the Result : Once the result is stored, we are able to visualize the data inf form of Charts. Follow the steps to check the result.
i.)	Open web browser. Type ‘localhost:8080’ (8080 is port number on which Grafana is running. It may vary in your case.)


ii.)	Navigate to + -> Dashboard. Click on Add, click on Graph.


iii.)	Click Panel Title, click Edit.


iv.)	Click on Metrics tab (below blank graph template). Select your database.


v.)	Click on Query tab to modify/add queries.
