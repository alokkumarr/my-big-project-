# This property is optional, will become mandatory if any SIP enviroment has limited port accessibility and
# other ports are blocked for security reasons. In this case SIP Executors to work properly
# it required to have reserved port series. sip_executors_reserved_port properties can be
# set for starting port number and SIP will auto calculate the number of required port
# based on number of SIP-Nodes, like Number of open series port required as (Number of SIP-node * 4 port)
# For example: if we have assigned 9801 is starting port and number of host is 2 then (2* 4), so 9801 to 9808 port
