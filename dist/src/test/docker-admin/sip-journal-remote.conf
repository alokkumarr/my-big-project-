# Workaround: The "-m" option to "journalctl" does not work in the
# current version of systemd in CentOS.  So store logs directly in
# /var/log/journal to work around that.  When systemd is upgraded to
# v233 or newer, `journalctl -m -f` can be used to view logs from all
# hosts and this can be removed.
